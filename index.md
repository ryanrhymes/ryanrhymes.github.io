I am the Chief AI Architect at Nokia, responsible for advanced analytics in IPR portfolio management and technology investment strategy. I hold a PhD in Computer Science and an MBA (in Finance and Strategy).

Prior to Nokia, I was a Senior Researcher at [Cambridge University](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lw525/) and a Postdoc fellow at [Queens' College](https://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/), where I created a [numerical analysis system](http://ocaml.xyz) and a [technology startup](https://ikva.ai/). I have broad research interest and have published [two books and many papers](https://liang.ocaml.xyz/research/).

I enjoy networking with people! Drop me a line and I am looking forward to hearing from you!
