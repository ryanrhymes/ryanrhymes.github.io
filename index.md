I am the Chief AI Architect at Nokia, responsible for advanced analytics in IPR portfolio management, technology investment strategy. I hold a PhD in Computer Science and an MBA (in Finance and Strategy).

Prior to Nokia, I had been a Senior Researcher at the [Cambridge University](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lw525/), where I created a [numerical analysis system](http://ocaml.xyz) and a [technology startup](https://ikva.ai/).

I have broad research interest in operating systems, computer networks, edge computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, high performance computing. I published [two books and many papers](https://liang.ocaml.xyz/research/).

I enjoy networking with people to hear different ideas! Drop me a line and I am looking forward to hearing from you!
