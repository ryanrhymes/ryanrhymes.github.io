I am a Senior Researcher at the University of Cambridge, affiliated with Queens' College. I research in operating system, computer networks, numerical algorithms, and information theory. I lead the development of the scientific computing infrastructure in OCaml.

I am an Intel Software Innovator. I designed and commercialised the fastest algorithm for approximate k-nearest neighbour indexing and search. I also teach and I am accredited as an Associated Fellow in Higher Education Academy.
