I am a Principal AI Architect at Nokia, focussing on IPR portfio management, investment management, and technology strategy. I am also a Senior Researcher at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lw525/) (affiliated with Queens' College), an Intel Software Innovator, a Fellow in the [Higher Education Academy](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/) in UK.

I have broad research interest in operating systems, computer networks, edge computing, machine learning, high performance computing, optimisation theory, big data, and Fintech. I lead the R&D of a popular [OCaml Scientific Computing System](http://ocaml.xyz). I love commercialisation and entrepreneurship, I designed the fastest [approximate K-NN](https://github.com/vioshyvo/mrpt) algorithm and co-founded a [Computer Lab](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) spin-off [iKVA Ltd.](https://ikva.ai/).

I enjoy networking with different people to share ideas and innovate. Drop me a line and I am looking forward to hearing from you!
