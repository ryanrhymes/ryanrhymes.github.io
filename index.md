I am a Senior Researcher at the University of Cambridge, affiliated with Queens' College. I research in operating system, computer networks, numerical algorithms, and information theory. I lead the development of the scientific computing infrastructure in OCaml.

I am an Intel Software Innovator. I designed and commercialised the fastest algorithm for approximate K-NN indexing and search. I serve as the director of a technical spinoff originated from the Computer Lab, as well as a senior datas scientist in a nordic consultancy company.

I enjoy teaching and communicating with people. I am accredited as an Associated Fellow in Higher Education Academy in UK.
