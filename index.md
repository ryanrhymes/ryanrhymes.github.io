I am a Principal AI Architect at Nokia, focussing on IPR portfio management, investment management, and technology strategy. I am also the Chief Scientific Officer at [iKVA](https://ikva.ai/) -- an AI startup specialised in knowledge management. I am a Senior Researcher at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lw525/) (affiliated with Queens' College).

I have broad research interest in operating systems, computer networks, edge computing, machine learning, high performance computing, optimisation theory, and Fintech. I lead the R&D of a popular [OCaml Scientific Computing System](http://ocaml.xyz).

I enjoy networking with people to hear different ideas! Drop me a line and I am looking forward to hearing from you!
