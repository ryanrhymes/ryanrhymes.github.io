I am a Senior Researcher at the University of Cambridge, affiliated with Queens' College. I research in operating system, computer networks, numerical algorithms, and information theory. I lead the design and development of the high performance scientific computing infrastructure in the functional language [OCaml](http://ocaml.xyz).

I am an Intel Software Innovator. I designed and commercialised the fastest algorithm for approximate K-NN indexing and search. I serve as the director of a technical spinoff originated from the [Computer Lab](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/), as well as a Senior Data Scientist in a nordic consultancy firm.

I enjoy teaching and communicating with people. I am accredited as an Associated Fellow in [Higher Education Academy](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/) in UK.
