I am a Technical Lead at Nokia, a Senior Researcher at the University of Cambridge (affiliated with Queens' College), an Intel Software Innovator, a Fellow in the [Higher Education Academy](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/) in UK.

I have broad research interest in operating systems, computer networks, edge computing, machine learning, high performance computing, and Fintech. I lead the R&D of a popular [OCaml Scientific Computing System](http://ocaml.xyz).

I love commercialisation and entrepreneurship. I designed the fastest approximate K-NN algorithm and co-founded a [Computer Lab](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) spin-off [Kvasir Analytics](https://kvasira.com/).

I enjoy networking with different people to share ideas and interest. Find me with the links below and drop me a line!
